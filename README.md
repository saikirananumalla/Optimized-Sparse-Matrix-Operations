# Optimized Sparse Matrix Operations

This project provides a Java-based matrix operation library focused on efficient handling of **sparse matrices**, along with standard square matrix operations. Built with extensibility in mind, the design uses inheritance and abstraction to allow easy optimization and reuse.

## Features

- 🧠 Optimized data structures for sparse matrices
- 🔁 Matrix addition and multiplication logic
- 🏗 Abstract classes for reusable architecture
- ⚡ Performance-oriented operations for large-scale matrices
- 🧪 Test cases for core matrix behavior

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Java
- **Design**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Testing**: JUnit
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA
